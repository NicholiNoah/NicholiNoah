**CHALLENGE:** Engineer an on-set, live compositing workflow that provides near instant playback of multiple video layers, each captured at varying speeds and framerates to save time and budget on an extremely complicated motion capture shoot.

**OPPORTUNITY:** It all comes down to one moment. After two years siloed in a closet-sized corner edit bay, I was thirsty to grow. Early in the storyboarding process, I identified a pain point the director needed to solve quickly. Three commercial productions with only two days access to  a very expensive motion capture camera crane system in a fully functioning hospital. Complex scenes had to precisely match multiple layers of video, each recorded at different frame rates and dolly speeds. The limited budget and even more limited access to indispensable surgery rooms only allowed a small window of time to complete each shot, but production could not move on until the director was confident all components aligned perfectly.
This was a chance to prove myself by providing more value than just editing clips together in post-production. Using only readily accessible equipment, I pieced together a unique editing/compositing pipeline allowed me to capture live footage in real time, immediately layer multiple video timespaces on top of each other, then play back less than a minute after the shot had just taken place.
