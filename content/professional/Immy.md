**CHALLENGE:** Create a teaser video showcasing a prototype augmented reality headset. The prototype is not accessible, and no demo content exists. Must use 100% stock (or newly shot) footage and music, with a 4-day turnaround.

**OPPORTUNITY:** In 2015, IMMY introduced me to virtual reality. Building a teaser video gave me an exciting chance to paint a picture of what I believed the future of VR tech could look like. Using progressively faster cuts and increasingly dramatic sound effects to build suspense, I maximized the limited stock footage to capture the viewer’s emotional attention. Then overlaid data graphics to capture their logical attention, and communicate industrial applications for this emerging tech to potential investors who had yet to imagine what this future could look like.
Nearly ten years later, this video looks very outdated. However, I’m proud that all it took was a few basic concepts to spark my passion for extended reality.
