    <h3>"What does a creative community look like?"</h3>
	<p style="font-family: arial">
	When our curator asked the above question three different times during the exhibition walkthrough, I knew it was important.</br>
	Several days of thought later, I realized my answer simply cannot be put into words. It's just too massive of a concept.</br></br>
	Instead of words, I will produce an experience that visualizes the creative community how I see it in my imagination.</br></br>
	Creative community is the relationship between artist, gallery, and audience.</br>
	Artist creates, gallery curates, audience appreciates and carries the message to new communities through conversation and sharing.
	Each role equally valuable, but only when supported by the other two.</br></br>
	<em>Unfolding</em> is a direct visualization of this process. Holding the very community you support in your hand while also embodying that very same community... while standing beside others in the community... who are also holding your community in their hand. Each print a seed, casted into the community to grow and increase support.
</p></br>
  <h3>Unfolding: An Augmented Reality Experience</h3>
  <p>Holding the world in your hand, you are the sunset. <i>Unfolding</i> is an augmented reality experience created to spark new perspective of human connection through technology.<br/><br/>
     1. Open your mobile device's camera and point it at the QR code.<br/>
     2. Click the pop-up on your screen to open the link.<br/>
     3. Tap "allow" to give <i>Unfolding</i> permission to use your camera.<br/>
     4. Continue pointing your camera at the QR code (in your other hand) while slowly rotating the paper back and forth.<br/>
     5. Rise and set your sunlight as Oklahoma Contemporary reflects beautiful colors.</p></body><br/>
	<p>TECH SUPPORT: Is the QR link broken or only showing a white circle?<br/>

 	<p>There is so much more I'd like to add to this project. Specifically, a direct link to the OK Contemp donation page, and interactivity so you can
    spin the crystal ball to see the entire sunset. And of course a full write-up with photos and magic and stuff.</p></br></br>
