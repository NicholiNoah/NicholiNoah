Challenge: 100% cinéma-vérité. Capture a live VR event with my newly developed stereoscopic camera interface while having absolutely zero impact on the event.

Opportunity: After months of development (among other projects), it was time to test my new stereoscopic VR recording system, and the Creator Jam Winter Holiday Party was just the place to do it. I'd been to events like this before. Just like in real life, everyone has a camera. And just like in real life, everyone with a camera naturally moves to the front of the crowd, blocking other people's view and mine. Rather than constantly fight my way to the front of the pack, I worked with leaders in the community to create a unique avatar that no one else could see, but I could still see my camera controls. It all worked far beyond my expectations. For two hours, I flew around people, in front of people, even inside people to catch the perfect shot every time. All while no one realized I was there (they'd already given permission of course). I'd captured a genuine life event while leaving less impact than a mere fly on the wall.
