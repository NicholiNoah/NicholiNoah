	<i>Devotion ($3/day)</i> promotes continued conversation on 'value of content vs. appeal of branding', a counterpoint to Andy Warhol's <i>Campbell's Soup</i> series, and palpable commentary on the public's consumption of branded media as social content.</br>
	Unassuming by design, <i>Devotion</i> captures the unseen discipline of the artist's process, shaped into a portrait of humanity every person can relate to: the need for food.</br>
	Baiting the audience to critique with "How is this art??? ...I could have done that." Devotion responds, "Yes."</br></br>
	Not discipline or religion. Nor performance art since it's not performing. Just a lifestyle adjustment.</br>
	It buys the freedom to stay in flow. With hunger as my vehicle, Creativity takes the wheel.<br><br>Equally inspired by Erique Chagoya's <i>Enlightened Savage</i>, a dark taste of artistic individuals as sustinance (labeled and mooshed into tin cans, then packed into a box for marketing and easy distribution).</br>
	<i>Devotion ($3/day)</i> was created out of necessity to survive. A diet designed to maximize budget and minimize distraction</br>
	while scraping together enough nutritional energy to dedicate everything I am to capturing a visionary life outside status quo.</br>
	Ripping off imposed labels. Clacking back the hermetically sealed tab.
	Releasing delectable aromas of self awareness.</br>This is the artist's process.
	Over and over again until the message is complete or dinner is ready. In this case, both.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">For months my imagination pounded a cloudy projection of the artwork in silhouette, stamped with a blinding white number '3' (an overly-aggressive guiding frequency increasing louder and brighter like it was annoyed I was taking so long to figure this puzzle out). At two weeks of tasting and trying again, I repeatedly rummaged the canned food isle matching assorted combos of beans and vegetables. Until one day with squeeky-wheeled cart and calculator in-hand, I felt the magical moment as everything added up to exactly $3.00. The recipe was complete.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">But how do I capture this magical moment for others to discover too?<br>I am an Accessibility artist. I want my audiences to feel the whole experience. Not just the food part.<br><br>Since so few people are prepared to wrestle a bright white screaming number '3' until it shuts up, my role as the artist is to draw others a map so they can find their own way, at their own pace.<br>Curious ones like me deserve to know the very same joy I felt when the numbers really did add up in real life.<br>The price has gone up since. That grocery store receipt is a photo in time.<br><br>
