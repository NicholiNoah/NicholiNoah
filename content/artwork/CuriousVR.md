What do you do when the whole world is in a pandemic and you're stuck by yourself in your room for several months?

That was the core inspiration for CuriousVR Show. It was also a great opportunity to calibrate my prototype mixed reality camera and grow the CuriousVR Youtube channel all at the same time.
