<b><i>My work is deceptively simple. Each piece is equal parts self-portrait, personal milestone, and science experiment.</br>From tailor-made to Readymade, I pair found object art with custom written software.</br>Breathing new life into everyday electronics purchased second-hand or found on the side of the road.</br>Encoding knowledge and awareness into reflections of hope, belonging, and the desire to be seen.</i></b>
