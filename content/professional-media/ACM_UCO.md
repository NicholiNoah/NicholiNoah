Showcasing the conceptual new music program, ACM@UCO as an edgy alternative to traditional music education. Challenge: stir excitement in high schoolers while assuring parents the downtown OKC campus is safe and positive; to be accomplished in three days with zero budget. Taking a music video approach, I focused on movement and rhythm to drive enthusiasm visually. 
This was the first spot UCO aired on primetime television, placed at peak time during American Idol.
