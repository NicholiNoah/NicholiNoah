This video helped secure funding and technology to pilot a K-12 virtual reality education curriculum based on Cherokee custom, made available in their native language. [Sevenstar Spatial Lab](https://www.sevenstarspatial.com/) was fully operational and successful for an entire semester before COVID lockdowns. While the world was wondering how their kids would go to school, Sevenstar continued uninterrupted through headsets and fiber optic internet. A culture of innovation dedicated to the future of their community.

The mission of the American Indian Resource Center, Inc. is to develop culturally appropriate resources to meet the needs of American Indian Communities. I am honored to have edited this video highlighting AIRCINC's continued evolution "to meet the ever changing needs of our dynamic world."
