  <h1>Unfolding: An Augmented Reality Experience</h1>
  <p>Holding the world in your hand, you are the sunset. <i>Unfolding</i> is an augmented reality experience created to spark new perspective of human connection through technology.<br/><br/>
     1. Open your mobile device's camera and point it at the QR code.<br/>
     2. Click the yellow pop-up on your screen to open the link.<br/>
     3. Tap "allow" to give <i>Unfolding</i> permission to use your camera.<br/>
     4. Continue pointing your camera at the QR code (in your other hand) while slowly rotating the paper back and forth.<br/>
     5. Rise and set your sunlight as Oklahoma Contemporary reflects beautiful colors.</p></body><br/>
     TECH SUPPORT: Is the QR link broken or only showing a white circle?<br/>

  <p>There is so much more I'd like to add to this project. Specifically, a direct link to the OK Contemp donation page, and interactivity so you can 
    spin the crystal ball to see the entire sunset. And of course a full write-up with photos and magic and stuff.</p><br/>
