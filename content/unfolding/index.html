  <h1>Unfolding: An Augmented Reality Experience</h1>
  <p>Holding the world in your hand, you are the sunset. <i>Unfolding</i> is an augmented reality experience created to spark a new perspective of human connection through technology.<br/><br/>
     Point your mobile device at the QR code, click the yellow pop-up to open the link, and cast your warm light onto the art center we all know and love.<br/>
     Continue pointing your camera at the QR code while slowly rotating the paper back and forth, setting your sunlight as Oklahoma Contemporary reflects beautiful colors.</p></body><br/>
     TECH SUPPORT: Is the QR link broken or only showing a white circle?<br/>
     Try using another web browser (Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) and opening <a href="https://nicholinoah.com/unfolding/gift">NicholiNoah.com/unfolding/gift</a>.
  </p><br/>
  <p>There is so much more I'd like to add to this project. Specifically, a direct link to the OK Contemp donation page, and interactivity so you can 
    spin the crystal ball to see the entire sunset. And of course a full write-up with photos and magic and stuff.</p><br/>
