  <p>Holding the world in your hand, you are the sunset. *Unfolding* is an augmented reality experience created to spark new a perspective of human connection through technology.<br/>
     Point your mobile device at the QR code, click the yellow pop-up to open the link, and cast your warm light onto the art center we all know and love.
     Continue pointing your camera at the QR code while slowly rotating the paper back and forth, setting your sunlight as Oklahoma Contemporary reflects beautiful colors.</p></body><br/>

  <p>There is so much more I'd like to add to this project. Specifically, a direct link to the OK Contemp donation page, and interactivity so you can 
    spin the crystal ball and see the sunset too.</p><br/>
