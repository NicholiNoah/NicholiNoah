Andrew Dayton is a developmental psychologist, Director of [Sevenstar Spatial Network](https://www.sevenstarspatial.com/), and community recognized Cherokee Medicine Man.</br>He is dedicated to preserving indegenous heritage through storytelling and technology.

From 2018 to 2021, I spent three seasons living at Andrew's homestead with his family. Developing experimental virtual reality by day, then walking the land and learning stories at night.</br>Andrew introduced me to XR's potential as a sociological and philisophical approach to teaching culture through balance of science and nature.

On a full moon evening in the fall of 2019, Andrew invited me to participate in a traditional Medicine Fire ceremony, allowing me to capture the magical event on camera. This experience changed the way I view our world, and in many ways myself.

Years later, I am still processing everything learned that night. As I revisit that time, I am gathering all the stereoscopic photos, videos, and sound recordings into a story that honors both Andrew and the Cherokee people.

*Wado*, my friend.

Synopsis and full storytelling series coming soon in extended reality.
