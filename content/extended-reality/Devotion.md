    <p style="font-family: arial">Inspired by Enlightened Savage and Andy Worhol's (in)famous Campbell's Soup Can, Devotion ($3/day) proposes an answer to the common critique, "How is this art? I could have done that.". Unassuming by design, Devotion relates the artistic process to something every human can relate to: the need for food. After committing myself to pursuing artistic expression, I found how valuable my time is.
	A direct commentary on perspective, artistic process, and the discipline to create a seemingly simple projection of everything it takes to be an artist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp#:~:text=The%20readymades%20of%20Marcel%20Duchamp,the%20found%20object%20became%20art." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcel Duchamp's <em>Readymades</em></a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fountain</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Advance_of_the_Broken_Arm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Prelude to a Broken Arm</em></a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukumogami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese tsukumogami</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Animism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Shinto animism)</a>, <em>To Be Free</em> employs found objects to symbolize humanity in technology. Each item acquired second hand, purchased at thrift stores or found on the side of the road. A connection of seemingly insignificant, unwanted objects thoughtfully assembled into an emotional story everyone can identify.</br>

    <p style="font-family:arial">Selling over 2 million units to schools and universities worldwide, Oculus Go offered a brilliant glimpse into our new era of extended learning. This newfound industry was exciting. An open book filled with endless futures.

However Go's impact fell far shorter than industy's expectations.

Purchased by the bundle, universities and primary schools were promised this curious new headset was the key to our future of education. However, without proper training or demonstration, teachers had no way to connect this strange new device to their classrooms. Some were so afraid of the headsets getting damaged, students weren't allowed to touch them. Others despised the technology as nothing more than a videogame distraction that doesn't belong.
At more than one high school, I watched their entire VR program get tossed into a laundry basket of unused headsets and shoved under a corner table where students will never find them. Millions of Gos never reaching their potential because they just weren't understood. Destined for government auctions, sold as scrap to the lowest bidder, then broken down and mined for it's gold, silver, and precious metals.</br></br></br>This makes me sad.</p>
