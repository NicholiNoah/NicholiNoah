    <p style="font-family: arial">"How is this art??? ...I could have done that."</br>
	A counterpoint to Andy Warhol's (in)famous Campbell's Soup series, <i>Devotion ($3/day)</i> promotes further conversation on 'value of food vs. appeal of branding'.
	Unassuming by design, <i>Devotion</i> captures the unseen discipline of Artists' process shaped into a portrait of humanity every person can relate to: our need for food.
	Baiting the viewer to critique with "How is this art??? ...I could have done that." <i>Devotion</i> snaps back saying, "Sure... but can you really?"</br>
	I dedicate this diet to my devoted self. Not discipline or religion. Nor performance art since I'm not performing. It is my lifestyle. It buys me the freedom to stay in flow. With hunger as my vehicle, Creativity takes the wheel.<br><br>Equally inspired by Enlightened Savage's darker glimpse of artistic individuals as sustinance (labeled and mushed into a can then packed in a box for easy marketing).</br>
	<i>Devotion ($3/day)</i> was created out of necessity to survive. A diet designed to minimize myself and maximize my time, while scraping together enough energy to dedicate everything I am to capturing this vision. Ripping off imposed labels. Pulling back the tab. Releasing the nutritional aroma of self awareness. This is the artist's process. Over and over again until the message is complete or dinner is ready. In this case, both.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">For months my imagination pounded into focus a hazy projection of the final piece stamped with a blaring white number '3': an overly-aggressive guiding frequency increasing louder and brighter like it was annoyed I was taking so long to figure this puzzle out. Two weeks of tasting and trying again, I repeatedly rummaged the canned food isle matching assorted combos of beans and vegetables. Until one day with squeeky-wheeled cart and calculator in-hand, I felt the magical moment as everything added up to exactly $3.00. The recipe was complete. The energy... calm.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">Selling over 2 million units to schools and universities worldwide, Oculus Go offered a brilliant glimpse into our new era of extended learning. This newfound industry was exciting. An open book filled with endless futures.

However Go's impact fell far shorter than industy's expectations.

Purchased by the bundle, universities and primary schools were promised this curious new headset was the key to our future of education. However, without proper training or demonstration, teachers had no way to connect this strange new device to their classrooms. Some were so afraid of the headsets getting damaged, students weren't allowed to touch them. Others despised the technology as nothing more than a videogame distraction that doesn't belong.
At more than one high school, I watched their entire VR program get tossed into a laundry basket of unused headsets and shoved under a corner table where students will never find them. Millions of Gos never reaching their potential because they just weren't understood. Destined for government auctions, sold as scrap to the lowest bidder, then broken down and mined for it's gold, silver, and precious metals.</br></br></br>This makes me sad.</p>
