    <p style="font-family:arial">"To Be Free" is my first sculpture, and has been an extremely difficult piece to complete.<br/><br/>Initially simple in design, the concept immediately solidified as soon as it entered my imagination.<br/><br/>However, the actual work took over six months to accomplish.<br/><br/>Overwhelmed by multiple emotional breakdowns and painful confrontations with my own childhood traumas.<br/><br/>Originally conceived in honor of Oculus Go and John Carmack, I eventually realized this piece captures a much deeper, more personal meaning, well beyond the story of the little VR headset that could.<br/></p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">Directly paralleled to the lifetime of struggle I face everyday as an Autistic adult, "To Be Free" is an expression of my yearning to be independent.<br/><br/>Endless attempts to identify with a society who refuse to see me. Speaking knowledge from a different perspective.<br/>Burning desire to be accepted.<br/><br/>Pushing myself as far as possible, yet constantly falling short of others' expectations that can never be appeased.<br/><br/>Abandoned into accepting my words will never be heard, no matter how loud I scream.<br/><br/>Still clinging onto a dream that one day I'll finally be included.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">Selling over 2 million units to schools and universities worldwide, Oculus Go offered a brilliant glimpse into our new era of extended learning. This newfound industry was exciting. An open book filled with endless futures. 

However Go's impact fell far shorter than industy's expectations.

Purchased by the bundle, universities and primary schools were promised this curious new headset was the key to our future of education. However, without proper training or demonstration, teachers had no way to connect this strange new device to their classrooms. Some were so afraid of the headsets getting damaged, students weren't allowed to touch them. Others despised the technology as nothing more than a videogame distraction that doesn't belong.
At more than one high school, I watched their entire VR program get tossed into a laundry basket of unused headsets, shoved under a corner table where students will never find them. Millions of Gos never reaching their potential because they just weren't understood. Destined for government auctions, sold as scrap to the lowest bidder, then broken down and mined for it's gold, silver, and precious metals.</br></br></br>This makes me sad.</p>

    <p style="font-family:arial">In 2020, Facebook announced the Go will no longer be supported, soon dissolving the Oculus brand entirely. Abandoned by the very parent company who made them, in favor of a new headset packaged with the same promises and even shorter lifespan. One year later, after <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441497813796356097?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several months lobbying Facebook</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Carmack</a> (creator of legendary videogames Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake) announced the now depricated <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496418368294914?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus Go is being unlocked</a>, officially removing Facebook's control of the device and your data. The freely available <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/unlocking-oculus-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">*fastboot oem unlock* bootloader</a> strips the devices software down to its root programming, allowing any developer with a dream to open Go's future without the need for Facebook's servers and restrictions.</p>
