**CHALLENGE:** Construction sites are too dangerous for educators to teach Construction Management courses on-location. Create a virtual experience providing students a safe alternative for identifying and documenting OSHA violations on an active construction site. Must be accessible to all students using available technology both in classroom and at home.

**BACKGROUND:** The first industry job newly graduated Construction Management majors apply for is documenting safety violations. This consists of visiting live construction sites, identifying issues, taking photographs, then writing a report with details for each violation. My goal was to replicate this process as accurately as possible, preparing each student with truly virtual on-the-job training.

**OPPORTUNITY:** The most widely discussed opponent of 360VR video is, “You can’t make viewers look where you want them to look.” While this is certainly difficult for traditional filmmakers, it is also provides a perfect opportunity to stimulate viewers who are supposed to seek out hidden elements on screen. This was the perfect project to implement this as a creative solution to a unique challenge.

    <p style="font-family:arial">Influenced by Highlights Magazine’s famous “Hidden Pictures” puzzles, we collaborated with the Construction Management department to record 360VR videos of mock OSHA safety violations on a working construction site. Viewing from the safety of their classroom or home, students were immersed in a live action construction site through their cellphone, tablet, or desktop, browsing each scene in search of violations in 360 degrees. Using their device’s screenshot feature, they would then “take a photo” of the issues, and include them in an industry standard Construction Safety Violation Report form. Upon graduation, students will have experienced hours of virtual “on-the-job” training, and be prepared to take their first steps into a new career.</p>
