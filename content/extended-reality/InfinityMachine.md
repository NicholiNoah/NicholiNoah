Infinity Machine is a study on stereographic cameras and 3D visual feedback. While simple in concept, my challenge was to refine a workflow to be as efficient as possible to produce the tightest slices of time. This spatial representation of time delay provided the visuals I needed to finally understand the 3D (camera) rendering pipeline. Additionally, I finally had visual proof that efficient coding can make quite a difference.
As luck would have it, Infinity Machine is just as fun as it was educational.
