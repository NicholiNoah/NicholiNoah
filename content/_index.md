---------------------------

Hi, I'm Nicholi.</br>A mixed reality artist and immersive technologist specializing in accessibility and culturally aware content. Fascinated with analog VHS tape-to-tape and computer animation in the mid-â€˜90s, I've always sought out alternative methods to learning through curiosity... which lead to a 25-year digital video career spanning broadcast, film, and virtual education. In 2011, Both career and curiosity pushed me to strap on a backpack to travel the world for a year before landing a six-year stint hustling advertising in Detroit while documenting street art with local graffiti writers.</br>

Back to Oklahoma City in 2017, I bought my first VR headset and focused on the Metaverse. Diving deeper than the shallow "social VR" facade, I spent several hundreds of hours collaborating on Open Source education tools with developers from Microsoft and Google. Learning to code while immersed in the environment I was coding was the experience I needed to finally grasp how the devices we carry in our pockets are powertools for accessible communication.</br></br>

Now I'm drawing all that knowledge out into the real world through artworks designed for others to share the same profound moments I had - without having to wear a headset.</br></br>

Weaving virtual textures into tangible materials so you can hold the experience in your hand.
