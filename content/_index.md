&nbsp; Hi, I'm Nicholi Noah. <br>
<br>
A Creative Technologist and curious storyteller with over 25 years of creative video knowledge, 5 years of project management & process development, 3 years leading junior creative teams, and a knack for finding patterns and solving problems. I believe in cultivating a culture of trust through awareness, empowerment, and open communication. My philosophy is that positive accountability and honest expectations lead to strong relationships and even stronger creative solutions.

We live in a beautifully emerging new era. Humans and machines working together, transcending greatness through accessible communication. From video camera to virtual reality, I'm expanding upon an award-winning creative career that stretches across advertising, education, documentary, and design with a focus on accessibility and cultural awareness. Seeking to collaborate on a team of dedicated future-thinkers determined to forge new tools out of wild ideas and teach our community we can all win this together.

Professional Bio:

That's a fancy way of saying I enjoy creating XR so much I've spent over 1,000 hours building immersive extended reality experiences while inside the Metaverse. Paralleled with a self-guided curriculum of virtual reality courses from Australia, UK, India, and Czech Republic, I'm procuring a unique connection to the Metaverse and passion for the opportunities technology provides.
