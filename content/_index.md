**Artist Statement:**
</br>I remember the first time I broke my imagination. It grew back with a vengeance.</br>
Revealing hidden perspectives that question our reality.</br>
Projecting virtual visions of augmented tomorrow. Without the need for a device.</br>

Welcome to my world of extended reality. Please enjoy your stay.


**Professional Bio:**
</br>4 years creating extended reality Open Source XR learning tools with devs from Microsoft and Google. That's a fancy way of saying I enjoy creating XR so much I've spent over 1,000 hours building immersive extended reality experiences while inside the Metaverse. Paralleled with a self-guided curriculum of virtual reality courses from Australia, UK, India, and Czech Republic, I'm procuring a unique connection to the Metaverse and passion for the opportunities technology provides. 

We live in a beautifully emerging new era. Humans and machines working together, transcending greatness through accessible communication. From video camera to virtual reality, I'm expanding upon an award-winning creative career that stretches across education, advertising, documentary, and design with a focus on accessibility and cultural awareness. Seeking to collaborate on a team of dedicated future-thinkers determined to forge new tools out of wild ideas and teach our community we can all win this together.
