Ever since I was a kid I've been fascinated by Time. With a capital "T" as in the very concept of Time itself. Pondering what Time looks like from a 4th dimensional perspective. In 4D Time is malleable like clay. To 4D, 3D space is nothing more than a 2D shadow on a 4D surface.

Light.


That means this imaginary concept must literally tear a hole in space to reveal 

To best accomplish this, I had to build an item that wasn't limited by what we 3rd dimensional beings know as space.
